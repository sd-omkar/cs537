To run:
1) Navigate to the directory that contains your mem.c and Makefile (and mem.h, which should match ours)
2) Run the script "runtests" that can be found in ~cs537-2/ta/tests/3a/. You may
   copy it to another location if you prefer.
3) Remember that you can pass the "-h" flag to the script to see more 
   testing options.

All of the tests for 3a are in ta/tests/3a/tests/. You can see what we
are testing and you can debug your solution by copying our C file test,
compiling, and running with gdb.
