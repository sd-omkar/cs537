To run:
1) Navigate to your xv6/ directory.
2) Run the script "runtests" that can be found in ~cs537-2/ta/tests/3b/ directory.
   You may copy it to another location if you prefer.
3) Remember that you can pass the "-h" flag to the script to see more 
   testing options.

===========================
!If you are failing a test!
===========================
All of the tests for 2b are user programs within xv6. You can find the code
for a test based on the test name. For the test "ticks", look for "ticks.c"
in ta/tests/3b/tests/ to see what it is testing/how you might be able to debug.
