To run the tests:

1. Navigate to the base directory of your xv6 code
2. From that directory, execute the runtests executable in this directory
  Like:  ~cs537-2/ta/tests/1b/runtests

The output from runtests will indicate which tests you have passed and which you failed (if any)

For more options available while testing, run '.../runtests -h'
