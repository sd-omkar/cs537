To run the tests:

1. Navigate to the directory that contains your fastsort.c
2. From that directory, execute the runtests executable in this directory
  Like:  ~cs537-2/ta/tests/1a-contest/runtests

The output from runtests will indicate which tests you have passed and how quickly your code ran

For more options available while testing, run '.../runtests -h'
