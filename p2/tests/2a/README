To run:
1) Navigate to the directory that contains your mysh.c and Makefile
2) Run the script "runtests" that can be found in this directory. You may
   copy it to another location if you prefer.
3) Remember that you can pass the "-h" flag to the script to see more 
   testing options.

===========================
!If you are failing a test!
===========================
All of the tests for 2a are in the subdirectories in ta/tests/2a/. For the
test "background2", look in the "background2/" subdirectory. In most dire-
ctories you will find 3 files: "in", "out", and "err". Unless otherwise
noted by a README file in the test subdirectory, "in" is given as a batch
file to your program, and the expected stdout is in "out" while the expe-
cted stderr is in "err".
